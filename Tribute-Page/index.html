                <h3 id="tribute-headline">Here's a time line of Dennis Ritchie:</h3>
                <ul id="tribute-list">
                    <li><strong>1967</strong>- Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research CenterIn 2020, the Computer History museum worked with Ritchie's family and Fischer's family and found a copy of the lost dissertation.</li>
                    <li><strong>1968</strong>- he defended his PhD thesis on "Computational Complexity and Program Structure" at Harvard under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer. However, Ritchie never officially received his PhD degree as he did not submit a bound copy of his dissertation to the Harvard library, a requirement for the degree.</li>
                    <li><strong>1970s</strong>- Ritchie collaborated with James Reeds and Robert Morris on a ciphertext-only attack on the M-209 US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000–2500 letters. Ritchie relates that, after discussions with the National Security Agency, the authors decided not to publish it, as they were told that the principle was applicable to machines still in use by foreign governments.</li>
                    <li><strong>1983</strong>- Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award "for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system".Ritchie's Turing Award lecture was titled "Reflections on Software Research"</li>
                    <li><strong>1997</strong>- Ritchie and Thompson were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum, "for co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language."[</li>
                    <li><strong>1999</strong>- Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the National Medal of Technology of 1998 from President Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, "led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age".</li>
                    <li><strong>2005</strong>- the Industrial Research Institute awarded Ritchie its Achievement Award in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system.</li>
                    <li><strong>2011</strong>- Ritchie, along with Thompson, was awarded the Japan Prize for Information and Communications for his work in the development of the Unix operating system.</li>

                </ul>

                    <p>Ritchie is best known as the creator of the C programming language, a key developer of the Unix operating system, and co-author of the book The C Programming Language; he was the 'R' in K&R (a common reference to the book's authors Kernighan and Ritchie). Ritchie worked together with Ken Thompson, who is credited with writing the original version of Unix; one of Ritchie's most important contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms.
                    </p>
                    <cite>-- The Fedora 16 Linux distribution, which was released about a month after he died, was dedicated to his memory.</cite>
